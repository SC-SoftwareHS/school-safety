        Mission
      </h2>
      <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '10px' }}>
        Our mission is very simple, to create a tool that will help schools and businesses respond
        immediately to active threat situations! It is our goal to produce and sell this technology
        manner that is affordable to all schools. Currently, technology is very expensive and many
        schools are limited in funding. The LockNow Safety App is a crisis and communication tool
        schools will value and can reasonably afford. Communication during a crisis is proving to be
        difficult, often failing during the worst situations. Any delay in communication can be very
        costly and dangerous to all involved. Our solution is a simple phone application that will
        alert users of a lockdown immediately and allow for continued exchange of critical
        information. Not only will it assist schools with intruders, it will assist them with other
        emergencies as well. When used in conjunction with an intercom, our app can help save costly
        seconds in a crisis. We hope you will be a part of our school safety community!

        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '10px' }}>
        My name is Randy Dougherty and I am the founder of The LockNow Safety App and the long time
        school administrator. I am fortunate to be in my 22nd year as a school administrator, with
        18 of those years spent as a high school principal. Throughout my experiences as an
        administrator, school safety has always been a priority. Being responsible for other
        peopleâ€™s children is not something that we school people take lightly. The most important
        thing we do as educators is get our kids home safely each day. I have used this experience
        to present school safety topics at MOASSP, MARE Administrator Conferences as well as other
        presentations.
